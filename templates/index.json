It was on clearance, but still cost a hefty 200 EUR.  <span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold\">Two weeks into using it, the stick snapped — right where the blade meets the shaft.</span> It was under warranty, so Aksels did what any customer would do: he went back to the store and asked for a replacement.\n\n<span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold \">But instead of standing behind their product, the brand pointed fingers.</span> They blamed him.

Broken sticks. Denied warranties. Empty promises. <span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold \">He realized this wasn’t bad luck. It was a broken system.</span>\n\nThat moment lit a fire.\n\nLater that year, Aksels joined forces with his close friend Reinis Nikulcevs — an engineer with a deep background in material science — to find out why so many sticks were failing. What started as a personal mission quickly became something much bigger. <span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold \">They uncovered what the industry had ignored for years: a smarter, science-backed way\nto design sticks that actually last. </span>"

But in practice? <span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold \">They didn’t hold up. </span> Durability was still an issue, and many of the so-called “features” turned out to be more marketing gimmick than real innovation. <span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold \">Worst of all, they cost a fortune — breaking both on the ice and in your wallet. </span>\n<br>\n<br>\nOn the other end of the spectrum were the low-cost sticks — the no-name brands, often produced in bulk in overseas factories. At first glance, they seemed like a tempting alternative. But it didn’t take long to see the cracks — literally. <span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold \">Some broke within days. </span>Others were designed so poorly that Aksels found actual ridges running along the inside of the shaft — completely throwing off performance and feel. <span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold \">Most of them were nothing more than cheap replicas of the big brands — poorly engineered and rushed out of factories in China without any real innovation or testing behind them.</span>\n<br>\n<br>\nBetween overpriced hype and unreliable knockoffs, players were left with a brutal choice: overspend for disappointment, or save money and\ngamble on junk."

Unlike lower-grade carbon often produced in China, Japanese carbon is manufactured under strict quality controls, ensuring precise fiber alignment, minimal impurities, and consistent tensile strength.\n\nThis matters on the ice. Higher carbon purity means stronger and more flexible fibers, which translate to better energy transfer, greater impact resistance, and a longer lifespan under intense gameplay conditions. Where cheaper sticks often rely on bulk carbon sheets with inconsistent quality — leading to weak spots and early breakage — the Myst One’s carbon structure is engineered for maximum durability and performance consistency."
