It was on clearance, but still cost a hefty 200 EUR.  <span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold\">Two weeks into using it, the stick snapped — right where the blade meets the shaft.</span> It was under warranty, so Aksels did what any customer would do: he went back to the store and asked for a replacement.\n\n<span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold \">But instead of standing behind their product, the brand pointed fingers.</span> They blamed him. No replacement. No apology. Just a cold rejection."

Broken sticks. Denied warranties. Empty promises. <span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold \">He realized this wasn’t bad luck. It was a broken system.</span>\n\nThat moment lit a fire.\n\nLater that year, Aksels joined forces with his close friend Reinis Nikulcevs — an engineer with a deep background in material science — to find out why so many sticks were failing. What started as a personal mission quickly became something much bigger. <span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold \">They uncovered what the industry had ignored for years: a smarter, science-backed way\nto design sticks that actually last. </span>"

But in practice? <span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold \">They didn’t hold up. </span> Durability was still an issue, and many of the so-called “features” turned out to be more marketing gimmick than real innovation. <span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold \">Worst of all, they cost a fortune — breaking both on the ice and in your wallet. </span>\n<br>\n<br>\nOn the other end of the spectrum were the low-cost sticks — the no-name brands, often produced in bulk in overseas factories. At first glance, they seemed like a tempting alternative. But it didn’t take long to see the cracks — literally. <span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold \">Some broke within days. </span>Others were designed so poorly that Aksels found actual ridges running along the inside of the shaft — completely throwing off performance and feel. <span style=\"color: #F49321; font-weight: bold \">Most of them were nothing more than cheap replicas of the big brands — poorly engineered and rushed out of factories in China without any real innovation or testing behind them.</span>\n<br>\n<br>\nBetween overpriced hype and unreliable knockoffs, players were left with a brutal choice: overspend for disappointment, or save money and\ngamble on junk."
